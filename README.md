# Usage

When using the library in browsers please include the two following lines (in the given order):

<script src="isodate.js" />
<script src="ibisense.core-latest.js" />

If the library will be used in IE browsers, some json polyfills would be needed. You can use 
either json2.js or json3.js libraries:

<script src="://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/json3/3.3.0/json3.min.js" />

Include this library before ibisense.core-latest.js.
